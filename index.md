### CPSC 120
* Lab 11

  This was one of my favorite labs because I was introduced to creating objects and working with public and private code. We also learned about constructors to access private members. I really liked the idea of creating objects and giving them properties in code. I learned how to properly use object-oriented programming concepts like constructors and encapsulation, which will stick with me going forward.

* Lab 7

  I enjoyed Lab 7 because it was fun to write functions that handled parking availability on different streets. I was still learning about vectors, so it was great practice. This lab helped me become more comfortable with using vectors and manipulating data stored in them.

* Lab 8

  This lab introduced me to an important concept: for loops. I learned both range-based loops and the traditional loop style. Writing the judge functions was also very enjoyable. I learned how and when to use different types of loops to process data efficiently.
