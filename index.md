I am a Computer Science major at CSUF, planning to graduate in 2027.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 11
This was one of my favorite labs because I was introduced to creating objects and working with public and private code. We also learned about constructors to access private members. I really liked the idea of creating objects and giving them properties in code. There are many possibilities with this concept, and this lab will definitely stick with me.

Lab 7
I enjoyed Lab 7 because it was fun to write functions that handled parking availability on different streets. I was still learning about vectors, so it was great practice. Overall, this lab helped me take another step toward becoming a more capable coder.

Lab 8
This lab introduced me to an important concept: for loops. I learned both range-based loops and the traditional loop style. Writing the judge functions was also very enjoyable.
